## Basic Tools

These tools do not use a real browser, so they're perfect for scrapping standards-based websites, but you may hit a wall trying to
scrap sites that abuse scripting (angular or react client only sites, other single page applications ...).

* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/)

## Less Basic Tools

These tools actually run in your own browser. 

* [WebScraper ](http://webscraper.io/) and its [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn)

## Ninja Tools

These tools will allow to run a scripted browser in the background, or even on a remote server or server farm. If you're doing
serious web-stealing/fuck-your-content work, then you should go here.

## Recipes

## Using Chrome Developper tools to autoload an infinite scrollable list

```javascript
function scrollDown() {
  window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight)
};
$(document).ajaxSuccess(function() {
  scrollDown();
});
```
