Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

## Web development

## Forms

There are two easy ways of creating, displaying, validating and normalizing web forms and web forms data in python (afaik).
If you're using django, you probably want to use <Link to="./djangoforms">Django Forms</Link>. If you're not using django, the only serious form framework
I found until then is <Link to="./wtforms">WTForms</Link>.

* <Link to="./djangoforms">Django Forms</Link>
* <Link to="./wtforms">WTForms</Link>

## Frameworks and toolkits

* <Link to="./django">Django</Link>
* <Link to="./aiohttp">aiohttp</Link>
* Tornado

## Authentication (JWT, OAuth, ...)

* [Python-Social-Auth](http://psa.matiasaguirre.net/) (with web framework adapters)
* [RAuth](https://rauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* [JSON Web Tokens](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Cookbook

```python
__path__ = os.path.dirname(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), __file__))
```
* [OrderedDict subclass implementing insertion methods to adjust the order](https://gist.github.com/jaredks/6276032)

## PyEnv

## Install python3 on recent OSX with working Sqlite3 and OpenSSL

```shell
CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -I$(brew --prefix sqlite)/include" LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -L$(brew --prefix sqlite)/lib" pyenv install -v 3.6.0
```
## Misc

  * [NetworkX](https://networkx.readthedocs.io/)
  * [Python Graph Library](https://github.com/pmatiello/python-graph) (old but looks simple and powerful)
  
## Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

Python, by its nature, does not justify using and IoC/DI container most of the time, but it can still be useful
in some cases.

Some searches about the state of the art ... (no opinion on the various libraries yet)
