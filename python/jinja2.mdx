Jinja is a template engine for the Python programming language created by Armin Ronacher.
It is similar to the Django template engine but provides Python-like expressions while 
ensuring that the template are evaluated in a sandbox. It is a text-based template language
and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as sourcecode.

The Jinja template engine allows customization of tags, filters, tests, and globals. Also, 
unlike the Django template engine, Jinja allows the template designer to call functions with 
arguments on objects. Jinja is Flask's default template engine.
