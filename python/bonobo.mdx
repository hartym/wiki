Bonobo is an [extract-transform-load toolkit for python 3.5+ ](https://bonobo-project.org/), aiming for simplicity.

Bonobo is a rewrite / cleanup of rdc.etl for Python 3.5+. It's a work in progress, but already useable. Maybe.

## Quick start

See the [Bonobo tutorial ](http://docs.bonobo-project.org/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).
