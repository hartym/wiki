## Configuration and authentication

Create users and virtual hosts:

```bash
RMQ_USERNAME=rmq_user
RMQ_PASSWORD=s3cr3tp4ssw0rd
RMQ_VHOST=rmq_vhost
rabbitmqctl add_user $RMQ_USERNAME $RMQ_PASSWORD
rabbitmqctl add_vhost $RMQ_VHOST
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p $RMQ_VHOST $RMQ_USERNAME ".*" ".*" ".*"
```
    
This is not persistent, will only live for the lifetime of the container. (todo: find documentation about this?)

Using the official docker image ([RabbitMQ on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/)), we can use an undocumented feature:
the entrypoint will read `/etc/rabbitmq/definitions.json` if it exists and use it to define entities in rabbitmq,
so if we derive our image from that adding this file, it will auto add them. 

Definitions file (`/etc/rabbitmq/definitions.json`):

```json
{       
    "users":[
            {"name":"rmq_user","password_hash":"...","tags":""},
            {"name":"rmq_admin","password_hash":"...","tags":"administrator"}
    ],
    "vhosts":[
            {"name":"/"}
    ],
    "permissions":[
            ...
    ],
    "parameters":[],
    "policies":[
            ...
    ],
    "queues":[
            ...
    ],
    "exchanges":[
            ...
    ],
    "bindings":[
            ...
    ]
}
```
TODO: WIP BELOW

To generate this file from current configuration, you need `rabbitmqadmin` script, which uses RMQ management plugin.

Official docker image provides the plugin it if the "management" tag is used.
