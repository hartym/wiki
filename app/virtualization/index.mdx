## Quick troubleshooting notes

On some networks, I had really slow DNS requests, making a real hell to use package managers like npm or gem (especially when building docker images). 

```shell
VBoxManage modifyvm <vm-name> --natdnsproxy1 on
VBoxManage modifyvm <vm-name> --natdnshostresolver1 on
```
