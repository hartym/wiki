Authors: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers
present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. These 23 patterns
allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable software without reinventing the wheel.

It's the absolute foundation for any serious software writer, on one side very simple and straightforward,
but also a definitive requirement.
