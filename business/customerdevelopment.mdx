description: Steve Blank's methodology for discovering and validating customer needs
---

Customer Development is a four-step framework created by Steve Blank that emphasizes discovering and validating customer needs before building products.

## The Four Steps

1. **Customer Discovery** - Test whether your problem/solution fit resonates with customers
2. **Customer Validation** - Build a repeatable and scalable sales process
3. **Customer Creation** - Create end-user demand and drive it to your sales channels
4. **Company Building** - Transition from learning and discovery to execution

## Key Principles

* **Get out of the building** - Talk to real customers instead of making assumptions
* **There are no facts inside your building** - Only opinions exist until validated by customers
* **Failure is integral to learning** - Pivot based on customer feedback
* **Focus on learning, not selling** - Early conversations should discover problems, not pitch solutions
