description: Eric Ries's methodology for building successful startups through validated learning
---

The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, is based on the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop:

## The Build-Measure-Learn Loop

1. **Build** → Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
2. **Measure** → Collect data on how customers use the product
3. **Learn** → Analyze data to validate or invalidate hypotheses
4. **Pivot or Persevere** → Make informed decisions based on learning

## Key Concepts

* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** - The simplest version that allows you to start the learning process
* **Validated Learning** - Testing hypotheses through experiments with real customers
* **Innovation Accounting** - Measuring progress when traditional metrics don't apply
* **Pivot** - A structured course correction based on validated learning
