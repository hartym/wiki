We live in an age of unparalleled opportunity for innovation. We're building more products 
than ever before, but most of them fail—not because we can't complete what we set out to 
build, but because we waste time, money, and effort building the wrong product. What we need 
is a systematic process for quickly vetting product ideas and raising our odds of success.
