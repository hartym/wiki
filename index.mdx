This is where I keep code snippets, opinions and ideas about computer related tools, amongst other things that
concerns topics of interest.

## Manifesto

* *Simple* is better than complex.
* *Choices* depends on the human, legacy, time and market contexts. 
* *Honesty* beats vanity on the long term.
* *Tools* are means, not goals.
* *Value* is what the customer gets.
