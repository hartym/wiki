This is the source repository of my knowledge base at http://romain.dorgueil.net/wiki/. Changes are notified to the
wiki application via a git hook, and each commit merged in main is live on the site a few moments after it exists.

This is a work in progress, started early 2014.

Feel free to suggest changes, although the why, what and how is left to my only consideration.
