Authentication
==============

Authentication is the process of actually confirming the truth of an attribute, most likely the identity claimed by an user.

It might involve confirming the identity of a person by validating their identity documents, verifying the authenticity
of a website with a digital certificate, determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating, or ensuring that a product
is what its packaging and labeling claim to be. In other words, authentication often involves verifying the validity of at
least one form of identification.
